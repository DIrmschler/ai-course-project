# Automated Anomaly Detection in Magnetic Crack Testing

Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary

This project demonstrates the potential of simple AI techniques for anomaly detection in industrial applications, specifically magnetic crack testing for forged components. Using simulated data and Python-based machine learning, the work explores methods like Isolation Forest and provides insights into their practical application.


## Key Sections
1. **Simulating Crack Detection**: Generating synthetic images for training and testing.
2. **Methods for Anomaly Detection**: Overview of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid approaches.
3. **System Workflow**: Data preparation, model training, and anomaly detection.
4. **Experiment Results**: High accuracy achieved with minimal code.
5. **From Experiment to Practice**: Steps toward industrial integration, including real-time processing and automation concepts.
6. **Extending AI Techniques**: Applications like audio-based anomaly detection for predictive maintenance.

## Highlights
- **Algorithm**: Isolation Forest for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- **Programming**: Implementation in Python using the `scikit-learn` library.
- **Industrial Relevance**: Concepts for automating magnetic crack testing with AI.
